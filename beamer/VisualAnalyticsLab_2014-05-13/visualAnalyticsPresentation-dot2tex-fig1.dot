\begin{frame}{Complex Patterns and Generating Mechanisms}
\begin{block}{Question}Do patterns that look complex or organic usually involve simpler, lower-level interactions? [like ants on a beach / flocking birds]
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Question}Does Visual Analytics study emergent, organic patterns, or the simpler behaviours that may have created them?

\begin{frame}{Collaborative Design as a type of Distributed Activity}
\bigskip

Why do people collaborate in design?
\begin{itemize}
\item Design problems may be too difficult for single designers
\item Participation required from diverse stakeholders
\item Demands for a range of technical expertise
\item Need for diversity of perspective
\item Requirements for local participation; local knowledge
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
In order to be able to solve most complex design problems, you need \emph{many minds}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Collaborative design has Centralized and Distributed aspects}
Centralized aspects
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong design concepts
\item Team identity; common purpose; common ground
\item Global attributes of the completed artifact
\item Total cost
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\pause
Distributed aspects
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple agents, multiple expertise, different points of view
\item Stakeholders` opinions and experiences
\item Proprietary information
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Coordination Theory and Distributed AI}
Three reasons why the actions of multiple agents need to be coordinated: \citep{jennings1996coordination}
\begin{enumerate}
\item because there are dependencies between agents' actions
\item because there is a need to meet global constraints, and
\item because no one individual has sufficient competence,
resources, or information to solve the entire problem.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Flocking Rules for Collaborative Designers?}
These might be appropriate rules for designers working together in collaborative teams:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Separation: avoid crowding your collaborators (let them do their jobs)
\item Alignment: steer towards average heading of your design collaborators (pay attention to where others are going)
\item Cohesion: steer towards average position of your design collaborators (don`t go too far astray from your collaborators)
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
Sources of Complexity
\begin{itemize}
\item To understand complexity you often have to analyze simpler behaviours that generate this complexity
\item Otherwise you won`t understand the source of the complexity
\item Don't assume that order always comes from some `higher power`
\end{itemize}

%\begin{frame}{Visual Analytics}
%\begin{block}{Hypothesis}Visual Analytics can be approached from both a visual and an analytical perspective
%\end{block}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Both approaches are necessary to achieve good results
% \item Do the results function well and are they visually compelling?
